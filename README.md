# unrolling_meets_data_driven_regularization
Contains python scripts for adversarially learning an iteratively unrolled reconstruction together with a data-driven regularizer for inverse problems (X-ray CT, in particular). 

* To run the codes, you need a Ubuntu 18.04/20.04 system with miniconda installed on it. The training and evaluation scripts were executed on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX 6000 GPU with 24 GB of memory. 

# Instructions to run the codes: 
* The phantoms used in our CT experiments are available (as `.npy` files) here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SHN-yti3MgLmmW_l0agZRzMVtp0kx6dD?usp=sharing. Download the `.zip` file containing the phantoms, unzip, and put inside the cloned directory where the scripts are kept.
* Download the folder containing some pre-trained models and unzip it: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/176uhC1WB-ooImD9cWJMqW_KRubW_kw06?usp=sharing.
* Create a conda environment with the required dependencies by `conda env create -f env_uar.yml`, and then activate it by `conda activate env_tomo`.  
* Run `python simulate_projections_for_train_and_test.py` to simulate the projection data and the FBP reconstructions, to be used for training the UAR generator and regularizer. Alternatively, download the pre-simulated projection data and FBPs (along with the images arranged patient-wise) used in the experiment from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gKytBtkTtGxBLRcNInx2OLty4Gie3pCX?usp=sharing.  
* Run `python unrolled_adv_reg_train.py` for training the proposed UAR approach. `lambda_adv_prior` is set to 0.1 in the script. Change it if you want to train for a different lambda. 
* To evalutate the UAR model(s) (both end-to-end and with refinement) on test data using pre-trained models, run `python unrolled_adv_reg_eval.py`. We have set `lambda_adv_prior=0.1` since it leads to the best performance. This script applies a pre-trained UAR model on all 128 test slices and computes the overall statistics.
